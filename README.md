README - GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT
====================================================

This is the README document for my repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project. 
This repo contains 3 other files:

- tidyset.txt: This is my submitted tidy data set.

- run_analysis.R: This is the script that performs the analysis that produces the tidy 
  data set depicted in tidyset.txt from the original data set indicated in course 
  instructions.

- CodeBook.md: This describes the variables and data in my final data set, tidyset.txt. It 
  also sets out the process that my script, run_analysis.R, uses to produce the tidy data 
  set from the original data set.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF SCRIPT 
 
To produce the tidy data set, download and unzip the original data (these can be found at 
the following URL): 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Open the R console and set the working directory to the top directory in the downloaded 
data (this directory is called 'UCI HAR Dataset'). 

Finally, copy the script in run_analysis.R to the R console and execute it. Your working
directory will now contain a file, 'tidyset.txt', that corresponds to the file of the 
same name in this repo.
